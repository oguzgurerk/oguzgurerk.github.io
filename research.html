<h2>New Directions on Outlier Analysis</h2>
<p class="research">As a senior project, under the supervision of Prof. Ümit Işlak, I worked on outlier analysis under heavy tails and multivariate generalizations of types of outliers. This was mainly motivated by the fact that in statistics, though the term outlier is often articulated in various fields, a consensus for a mathematical definition for an outlier has not been established yet. The purpose was to investigate and to propose definitions of types of outliers so that we can minimize the number of data/domain-specific parameters for the working definition to have qualities that we expect from a rigorous mathematical definition to possess. It has often been a challenge to generalize the definitions to higher dimensions and to see if (and how) the new notions of outliers relate to some important results in probability theory and statistics; e.g. to the law of large numbers and heavy-tailed distributions. 
<br> <br>
I worked on both discrete and continuous problems concerning outlier detection; the problem of detecting anomalies in discrete/symbolic sequences where several anomaly detection techniques use the length of the longest common subsequence as a similarity measure, and for the continuous case, our approach was based on the distances between different order statistics, and employing moving averages to investigate the tail behaviors of hypothetical and/or empirical distributions in a more refined way.

<h2>A Study on Permutation Graphs (joint with Ümit Işlak and Mehmet Akif Yıldız)</h2>
<p class="research">
For a given permutation &#x3C0;<sub>n</sub> in S<sub>n</sub>, a random permutation graph is form be including
an edge between two vertices i and j if and only if (i - j)(&#x3C0;<sub>n</sub>(i) - &#x3C0;<sub>n</sub>(j)) &lt; 0.
In this paper we study various statistics of random permutation graphs. In particular, we prove
central limit theorems for the number m-cliques and cycles of size at least m. Other
statistics of interest are the number of isolated vertices, number of vertices with a given
number of degress, the distribution of a given node and extremal statistics. Besides,
we introduce the directed versions of random permutation graphs, and provide two
distinct paths that would generalize the results of this paper.
